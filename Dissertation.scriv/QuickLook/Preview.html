<br/>
The trend in numerical weather prediction is toward the use of fine grid meshes capable of resolving atmospheric motions down to the turbulence scale. The ability to reproduce credible  small-scale spatial variability of meteorological fields is appealing to both operational and research environments. For instance, air pollution applications rely on accurate representation of the dispersive role of small-scale motions. Another example includes propagation of electr...</p>

<br/>
The goal of this study is to examine the current state of the art downscaling techniques for purposes of representing atmospheric turbulence. The most obvious and flexible solution is the use of the WRF model to examine the extent to which a mesoscale model is capable of producing accurate turbulence parameters . Next, the numerics of two LES codes are investigated by means of idealized CBL simulations for differing flow patterns (with and without shear) . In order to test i...</p>

The WRF model’s governing equations are described here, building upon those contained in [#Skamarock;] and [#Lund2010;]. The equations are derived from the inviscid, compressible form of the Navier-Stokes equations.

The microphysics package includes explicitly resolved water vapor, cloud, and precipitation processes. In the WRF model, the microphysics scheme is employed at the end of each time-step as an adjustment process. This guarantees that the final saturation balance is accurate for the updated temperature and moisture fields.

Atmospheric radiation schemes account for atmospheric heating due to radiative flux divergence and surface downward longwave and shortwave radiation for the ground heat budget.

Land-surface models (LSMs) use atmospheric information from the surface layer scheme, radiative forcing from the radiation scheme, and precipitation forcing from the microphysics and convective schemes, together with internal information on the land's state variables and surface properties, to provide heat and moisture fluxes over land and sea-ice points.

Relations between \\(\phi\\) functions and \\(\zeta\\) were experimentally estimated by [#Dyer;] for the three major stability regimes discussed in [#Zhang;]. The regimes are classified as: stable (\\(\mathrm{Ri} > 0.2\\)), damped mechanical turbulence (\\(0.2 > \mathrm{Ri} > 0\\)), and forced convection (\\(\mathrm{Ri} \leq 0\\)).

This surface layer scheme is also based on [#MO;] similarity theory, with adjustments following [#Jan94,Jan96,Jan02;].  The scheme assumes that turbulent fluxes are constant with height and that boundary conditions are to be prescribed at two levels, \\(z_1\\) and \\(z_2\\).

Similar to other surface layer schemes, the Total Energy-Mass Flux (TEMF; <!--\citealt{Angevine2010}-->) scheme specifies fluxes that act as the lower boundary condition in the WRF model. Generally, these schemes assume a constant flux layer in order to apply similarity theory. The TEMF scheme, however, considers that the first model level may comprise a relatively large fraction of a shallow boundary layer. Thus, such a circumstance would likely invalidate the assumptio...</p>

atmospheric column, not just within the boundary layer. This means that explicit vertical diffusion<br/>

As stated in Section ([](#pbl-26)), the PBL scheme in the WRF model is tasked to parameterize the vertical diffusion within a grid column. Subsequently, horizontal diffusion must be separately considered when a PBL scheme is implemented. When the WRF model is run for real-data cases, the recommended subgrid closure is a two-dimensional, first-order approach. If, however, the WRF model is run in LES mode (WRF-LES), the subgrid closure is responsible for diffusion...</p>

For purposes of real-data cases, when the WRF model employs a PBL scheme the preferred subgrid closure scheme is a first-order closure approach following that from [#Smag;]. This scheme was formulated for large-scale atmospheric flows, and therefore eddy viscosities are assumed proportional to horizontal deformation. For momentum, the horizontal eddy viscosity is defined as<br/>

Previous studies have suggested that, for scale ranges characteristic of CBL processes, the validity of commonly employed subgrid turbulence parameterization is questionable for model applications with grid spacing in the \\(1\\) to \\(4\\) \\(\kilo\metre\\) range. While this feature of model performance is not novel, the goal was to demonstrate and quantify implications of running the WRF model with such grid spacings for prediction of near-surface turbulent flow paramet...</p>

The WRF model has evolved toward a self-contained numerical weather prediction system, capable of modeling atmospheric motions ranging from global to microscales. The promise of such capability is appealing to both operational and research environments where accurate prediction of turbulence is increasingly desirable.
